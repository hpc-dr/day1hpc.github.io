Quantum computers promise to revolutionize computation for problems across many industrial sectors, though understanding exactly how useful this technology will be remains an open question. In this blog post, the team from Strangeworks, an AWS Partner, evaluates different implementations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) against an aircraft cargo loading problem posed by Airbus [â€¦]
