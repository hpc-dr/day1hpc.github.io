AWS Parallel Cluster and AWS Parallel Computing Service are not the same thing.

Today we dive into some of the quirky, pizza-fueled history of ParallelCluster, tracing its roots back to an open-source experiment, and explain how evolution produced PCS: a fully managed service that takes the heavy lifting out of building and running HPC clusters.

From cable ties to elastic queues, we explore the tradeoffs between control and convenience in cloud-based high performance computing.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
