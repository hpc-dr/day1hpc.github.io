AWS Parallel Computing Service (AWS PCS) now supports accounting, a Slurm feature that enables you to monitor resource utilization, enforce resource limits, and manage access-control to specific capacity across users and projects in a cluster. AWS PCS manages the accounting database for the cluster, so that you don’t have to setup and manage a separate accounting database. In this post, we’ll show you how this works, and point you to some actual use cases you can try yourself.
