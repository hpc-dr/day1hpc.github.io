This conversation with Dr. Nathan Brown dives into how modern drug discovery has shifted from trial-and-error wet labs to computation, algorithms, and AI-driven molecular design. We talk about why chemical structures are now treated as data, why open datasets and shared tooling have been transformative, and how genetic algorithms and large language models are being used to explore chemical space that’s too large for humans to reason about directly.

We also break down why data access – not compute – is a key bottleneck, how pharmaceutical companies are adapting (or failing to), and why the future of drug design requires fewer repetitive experiments and more high-leverage scientific judgment.

If you want to understand where new medicines will actually come from in the next decade, this is the discussion to watch.
