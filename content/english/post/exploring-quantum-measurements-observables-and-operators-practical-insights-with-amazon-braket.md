Introduction In this post, we explore the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of quantum measurement techniques using Amazon Braket. We examine this subject through multiple perspectives: action of gates as basis transformation, projection as inner product, projector formalism, and observable formalism. A key insight that we’ll develop is understanding basis transformations as tools for converting […]
