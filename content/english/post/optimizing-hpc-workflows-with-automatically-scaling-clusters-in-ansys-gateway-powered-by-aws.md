Ansys Gateway powered by AWS now has an integration with AWS ParallelCluster to enable users deploy on-demand HPC clusters for running Ansys simulations on AWS. This allows engineers to run large-scale simulations efficiently while optimizing cloud costs by dynamically adjusting resources based on simulation workload requirements. In this blog post, we describe the architecture, workflow, and Amazon EC2 recommendations for running Ansys applications in Ansys Gateway.
