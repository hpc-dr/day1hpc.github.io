Defects in crystals are leading qubit candidates for quantum information networks. The ability to efficiently model defects, like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and their environment would deepen our understanding of these complex quantum systems and accelerate the use of these defects in scalable quantum networks. To study complex quantum systems like these and advance basic research [â€¦]
