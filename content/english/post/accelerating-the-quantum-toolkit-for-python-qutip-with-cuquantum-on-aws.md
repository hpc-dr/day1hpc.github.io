Simulating quantum systems using classical computers remains a computational challenge. In fact, the resources required for these simulations scale exponentially with the size of the system being simulated. This fact is at the core of the motivation to build a quantum computer. Quantum computers have the potential to surpass even the most powerful supercomputers when [â€¦]
