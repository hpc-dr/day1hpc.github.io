In life sciences research, managing large-scale computational resources and data efficiently is important for success. However, traditional on-premises environments often struggle to meet these requirements effectively. This post demonstrates how JSR Corporation transformed their research infrastructure using AWS ParallelCluster and AWS DataSync, achieving a 33% reduction in CPU usage and 85% in storage requirements. JSR’s […]
