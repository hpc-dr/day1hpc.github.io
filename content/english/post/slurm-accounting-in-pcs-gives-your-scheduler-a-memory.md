In this Tech Shorts episode, Matt Vaughn returns to dive into the power of Slurm accounting in AWS PCS

Why it matters, how it gives clusters “memory” of past workloads, and how that transforms scheduling, efficiency, and user fairness.

From tracking GPU usage and setting quotas, to enabling policies that balance entire departments’ needs, Slurm accounting unlocks smarter resource allocation and deeper insights.

The best part? PCS makes it as simple as a checkbox—no messy databases to manage, no fragile setups. Whether you’re curious about HPC cost control, performance optimization, or building sophisticated policies for your teams, this episode shows how accounting turns Slurm into something far more powerful than a scheduler.
