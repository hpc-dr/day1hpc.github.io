Wondered what’s really going on *under the hood* of Research and Engineering Studio in AWS (RES)? 

This episode of Tech Shorts pulls back the curtain with Matt Vaughn, diving deep into why RES was built and how it’s quietly transforming how researchers and engineers access high-performance computing environments.

We dig into new upgrades—like project owner roles, fine-grained permissions, and mountable Amazon S3 file systems—that make secure research environments more powerful and flexible than ever.

Whether you're running HPC workloads, dealing with sensitive data, or just tired of fighting clunky infrastructure, this conversation gives you a clear view of what’s next for ReZ.
