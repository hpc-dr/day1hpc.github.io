Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of exchanging encryption keys that complements traditional and post-quantum cryptography by offering a different kind of security guarantee: the ability to reveal whether a key exchange has been observed or disrupted. This blog explores BB84[i] —the first and most well-known QKD protocol—to illustrate how quantum principles can be […]
