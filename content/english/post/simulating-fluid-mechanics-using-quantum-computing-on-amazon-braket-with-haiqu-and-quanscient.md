Numerical simulations of complex fluid dynamics, electromagnetics and thermomechanical problems are crucial in the automotive and aerospace industries for designing and optimizing components like airplane wings, yet modeling continuum physics on high-resolution grids pushes classical computing to its limits. Quantum computing offers a potential path to overcome these barriers by encoding large simulation grids with [â€¦]
