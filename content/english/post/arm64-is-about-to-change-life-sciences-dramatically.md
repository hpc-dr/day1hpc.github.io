After a long break to recover from vision loss caused by my immune system, Tech Shorts returns.

Appropriately, we're focusing on how cutting-edge compute can drive breakthroughs in life sciences. Today we dive into how ARM-based architectures like AWS Graviton are transforming bioinformaticsâ€”making it faster, cheaper, and more sustainable to tackle diseases.

Our guest is Angel Pizarro and he explores how shared pipelines, open data, and community collaboration can accelerate discoveries that matter to us all.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
