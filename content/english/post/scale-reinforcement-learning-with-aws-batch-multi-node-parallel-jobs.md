Autonomous robots are increasingly used across industries, from warehouses to space exploration. While developing these robots requires complex simulation and reinforcement learning (RL), setting up training environments can be challenging and time-consuming. AWS Batch multi-node parallel (MNP) infrastructure, combined with NVIDIA Isaac Lab, offers a solution by providing scalable, cost-effective robot training capabilities for sophisticated behaviors and complex tasks.
