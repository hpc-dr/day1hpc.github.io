We dig into how Toyota Research Institute trained a new kind of robot model — not a language model, but a large behavioral model that learns physical tasks from demonstration. No scripting step-by-step movement. No hard-coded routines. Just “Set the breakfast table,” and the robot figures it out.

Tom Berggraf, Head of Product for AWS Batch, explains how TRI used batch + SageMaker integration to train these models efficiently at scale, and why this matters for real-world robotics: elder care, home tasks, industrial maintenance, and any future where robots work alongside people.

This is a clear shift: robots that learn by watching, adapt, and execute complex sequences smoothly. It’s the closest we’ve seen yet to “useful domestic robots” that anyone could command.
