Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of local device emulator on Amazon Braket. This feature enables developers to emulate their verbatim circuits based on device calibration data. Local device emulation helps accelerate the development cycle by providing early feedback on circuit compatibility and expected behavior in the presence of noise. In this post, we […]
