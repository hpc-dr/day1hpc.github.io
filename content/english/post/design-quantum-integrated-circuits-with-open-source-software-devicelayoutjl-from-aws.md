Today, we are introducing DeviceLayout.jl, a software package for computer-aided design (CAD) of quantum integrated circuits. At the AWS Center for Quantum Computing (CQC), we use DeviceLayout.jl to design superconducting quantum devices on our path to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer—devices we’ve used for experiments like “Hardware-efficient error correction using concatenated bosonic qubits” (our “Ocelot” […]
