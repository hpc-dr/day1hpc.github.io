This post was contributed by Jiaqi Leng, Joseph Li, Xiaodi Wu Scientists and engineers face numerous computational challenges in fields like fluid dynamics [1], modeling heat and sound propagation [2], and aircraft design [3]. Simulating partial differential equations (PDEs) in high dimensions offers a powerful approach to addressing these challenges. However, solving these high-dimensional differential […]
