Given a three-dimensional model of a drug’s potential target (the binding site), what is the orientation of the drug candidate molecule that best “fits” (docks onto) this binding site? Structure-based drug design involves the use of computational tools to answer this very question! Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a leading Japanese pharmaceutical company, specializes in the […]
