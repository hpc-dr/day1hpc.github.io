This post shows how quantum reservoir computing (QRC) can tackle machine learning challenges using Rydberg-atom quantum computers. Readers will learn how QRC works, see its performance on image classification and time series prediction tasks, and understand when it outperforms classical methods—particularly for small datasets in pharmaceutical research. After decades of progress, machine learning (ML) has […]
