Quantum computing promises breakthroughs in chemistry simulations. However, building scalable calculations on today’s noisy quantum hardware remains challenging. This blog introduces Kvantify Qrunch software on Amazon Braket. It enables advanced chemistry calculations using efficient hybrid quantum algorithms on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Chemistry is at the heart of several industries with profound economic […]
